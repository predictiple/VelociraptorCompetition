name: Custom.Server.DispatchTriage
description: |
  This artifact retrieves records from completed flows, groups them by the
  unique combinations of magid_id and file_accessor.
  
  The MonitoredArtifacts table allows you to configure which artifact
  completions to listen for.
  
  It then looks up the magic_id in the ResponseMap lookup table in order to
  determine which client artifacts to dispatch next, for each magic_id type.

  The dispatched client artifacts are sent a list of file targets and the
  file accessor to use (the same one that was used when detecting their file
  type).

      Client artifacts that will be monitored for completions.
      ** Remove System.VFS.DownloadFile from this list if you DO NOT want to
      use the modified version of that artifact which is included in this
      demonstration set **

    description: |
      A table of mappings that pair incoming magic_id values from the
      Custom.Client.FindByMagics artifact to reponse artifacts.
      Any reponse artifacts that you create should accept a list of file
      paths named "targets" and an associated "file_accessor" value.
